# PieB

More and more services of large transnational compa- nies are deployed on cross-datacenter region wide area networks (DR WANs), making the synchronization of data duplication among DRs becomes the key concern. However, large data synchronization and optimal delivery across Internet datacenters (IDCs) poses many specific challenges, such as the ever-changing data duplication information and the selection of data source and destinations. These characteristics lead to a new Traffic Engineering problem with Uncertain information (UTE), which is much more complex than the traditional Traffic Engineering (TE). In this project, we design, implement, deploy and evaluate a software-driven system, PieBridge, a cross-DR large data transmission scheduling system, which accommodates the large data synchronization among IDCs on the WAN networks of an industrial company.
